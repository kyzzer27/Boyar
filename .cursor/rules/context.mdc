Prompt for Cursor Application: Boyar Partners Dashboard Web App

Build a professional dashboard web app for “Boyar Partners” for use by both investors and the internal team.

App Name: Boyar Partners

Core Principle: Each primary dashboard tab (Pitch, Products, Pricing, CAC) will function as a central hub for relevant data, file storage, and analytical visualizations. Users will be able to view data, download associated PDF and Excel files, and interact with analytical displays pertinent to that tab.

Views/Tabs in the dashboard:


1. 
Pitch


	- Content: Pitch deck slides, key market summary, business highlights, and mission statement.

3.

4. 
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)


	- Content: Table, charts, and key metrics showing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by service and by region.

	- File Storage: Allows uploading and downloading of CAC Reports (PDFs) and Raw Acquisition Data (Excel) for transparency and further analysis.
